# Todo Application
**Here I create a Todo List app where I add some functionality such as Create Todo, Edit Todo,Update Todo and and Remove Todo. Also these todo are saved in local storage where we refresh the page todo are showing as it is.**

- Here I take the value from input and show the value on the page using dom manipulation.
- Also add the edit button and delete button.
- Using edit button we can update the todo.
- Using remove button we can delete the todo.
- These todo are saved in local storage, so that todos are not delete when refresh the web   page.
